## Blockchain that I want
First, Ara is the blockchain platform where our customers are not the end users but developers.
Our blockchain stands out because it provides a client and an app store.
Think of the blockchain as a decentralized machine. The browser allows you to search for all software installed there and is also a platform that will enable you to use it. Like on your phones, you have App Stores, or on Computers, you have Marketplaces or programming languages that come with package registries. 

And no blockchain comes with that. The reason why we don’t make it simply as a client for the current platforms but an entirely new blockchain is not technical but ethical it relies on capital. This capital is built into technology. Namely, if I make a client and the tools for the software, then the blockchain creators and early adopters will be billionaires. Especially if I use their native coin as the client’s coin as well. Why does someone else have to be richer than me because of my software? And this premise would prevent the appearance of any killer dapps on the platforms. So better approach will be one app in one blockchain.


Second, because of the technological limitations, we can set up a small apps running on the blockchains. This apps are called smartcontracts and can’t exceed few kilobytes in size. The more computation means the expensive it is. But all the apps are stored together, in the same platform. And also blockchain means, this softwares can be controlled by the people who make it.

So it gives us a potential to generate apps for the users desires because they are small. That allows us to train the programs We can train the AI to write them by learning all the software on the blockchain as well.
