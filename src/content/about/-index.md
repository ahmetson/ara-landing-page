The Ara community does not claim that open-source implies developers work for free.

It's also not a community of techno-optimists. Our focus is on the people who create the technology, not the technology itself. Specifically, in a group rather than on one person.

Our goal is to create a network of open-source, interoperable apps by collaborating on protocols, libraries, and other developer-related technologies as well as solutions that bring end users and open-source developers closer together. By building a "living organism", we aim to  create an internet that sparks creativity on everyone, where innovation is available for everyone.

We also differ from other communities in terms of perspective. The majority regard computers as Information Technology and concentrate on data. We see things differently. Rather than focusing on data, we regard computers as a software evaluators. *I recommend it even if you address data related challanges.*

> Let me introduce myself.
> I'm Medet Ahmetson, a main contributor of Ara! On Ara's Youtube channel, on blog posts, I share historical stories about failures because people focus on data. So, check them out for little-known facts.

The purpose of our community is to bring software developers together and support one another. And together make the Internet as a creative hub for end users.

I purposefully avoided using the word "decentralized" anyplace else on the website.
It grew so popular that people stopped caring about it.  Therefore, we refer to our work rather than a catchphrase.
However, our objective is decentralization, that we carry in our community. :)

## Only rule in community engagement

The most important rule in engaging in Ara Community:
No promotion of a certain belief or life-values. 
If members values are different, then we don't boycot, ghos that member, instead, we talk only about Ara Projects.

Internet, as interconnected computers around the world where we share the news, share the knowledge is a place that unite everybody who work on common goal the result which will be beneficial for all.
It's a place where North Korean and South Korean could work together if they work on Ara project.
It's a place where Palestinian and Israeli work together, even if they have totally different political perception and won't agree in real life.
It's a place where Ukrainian and Russian work together on a project that will benefit both countries internet users.

If you agree with it and do not choose "cancel," then welcome to our community!

## What are you able to do?
Start developing apps with our libraries and packages already. And if you're doing so, please let us know by tagging on your post. Help us by contributing to the products you use to make them adopted worldwidely. Share and talk about your experience on how did you use Ara tech, even if its bad. Since feedback is welcome, we are happy to incorporate insightful critique into the code.

Your participation as an Ara core contributor would be greatly appreciated as well. Our roadmap includes a few projects. If you would want to propose yourself as the maintainer for future projects, please contact me at medet@ara.foundation.

If you don't have the time for contributing by a work, then, follow us on social media so we can notify you when a new feature released. Perhaps future updates from Ara will pick your interest?

Lastly, to communicate with other developers, join our Telegram group. And please introduce yourself when you join us.

> Telegram, unlike Discord offers a full-acess API. In a long term we are working on a collaborator tool where we will integrate the Telegram UI into the collaboration platform.
> Choosing Telegram right now is a long term decision.
